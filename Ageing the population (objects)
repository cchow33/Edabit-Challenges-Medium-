Given an object of people and their ages, return how old the people would be after n years have passed. Use the absolute value of n.


function afterNYears(names, n) {
	for (var k in names) {
		names[k] += Math.abs(n);
	}
	
	return names;
}

OR ...

afterNYears = (names, n) => {
  for (var k in names) {
    names [k] += Math.abs(n);
  }
  return names;
}
